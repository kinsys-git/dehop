An easy way to organize dotfiles and packages between desktop environments

At the moment this is configured for Solus, but it's easily tweaked for any other distribution- just change the install and remove commands near the bottom of the script.

Before using this make sure to edit the top of the script with your variables. 
The universal directory is for dotfiles that you carry with you on each different instance, and is configured to be a directory within the root of your dotfiles folder.

Package files are for installing and uninstalling the desktop enviroments with a list of packages matching the desktop environment name.

If you plan on using this, it makes a lot more sense just to read through the script. It's not long or complicated, and just makes moving over in a clean fashion easy without mixing your dots together.
